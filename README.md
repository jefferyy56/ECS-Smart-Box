# ECS Smart Box 📦

![ECS Smart Box Logo](https://example.com/ecs-smart-box-logo.png)

Welcome to **ECS Smart Box**, a powerful C++ implementation of a basic Entity-Component-System using heap-allocated, type-erased components. This system utilizes a mechanism similar to `unique_ptr` to manage memory efficiently while offering flexibility to build complex interactive systems.

## Features 🚀

🔹 **Heap Allocation**: Components are allocated on the heap to optimize memory usage and provide dynamic storage capabilities.

🔹 **Type Erasure**: Components are stored in a type-erased manner, allowing for generic handling and ease of use across different component types.

🔹 **Entity-Component System**: Follows the ECS architectural pattern for organizing and managing game entities and their associated components.

## How to Use 🛠️

To get started with **ECS Smart Box**:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Build the project using a C++ compiler.
3. Include the necessary headers in your application.
4. Create entities, add components, and define systems to interact with them.

Here is an example code snippet to demonstrate how to use the ECS:

```cpp
#include <ecs/ecs_manager.h>

int main() {
    ECSManager ecsManager;

    // Create entities
    Entity& player = ecsManager.createEntity();
    
    // Add components
    player.addComponent<TransformComponent>(x, y);
    player.addComponent<RenderComponent>("player_sprite.png");

    // Define systems
    MovementSystem movementSystem;
    RenderSystem renderSystem;

    // Update systems
    movementSystem.update(ecsManager);
    renderSystem.update(ecsManager);

    return 0;
}
```
